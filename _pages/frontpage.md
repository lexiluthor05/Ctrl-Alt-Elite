This website was developed to house all necessary materials and resources needed for students to participate in the T3-CIDERS Introductory Workshop on Computer Command-Line Interface, created by Elexiah Smart under the guidance of Dr. Wirawan Purwanto, Dr. Peng Jiang, Dr. Mohan Yang. In this workshop, high school students learn about the command-line interface (CLI), a fundamental yet powerful way to interact with computers. 


What is the Command Line Interface?
======
The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with software and operating systems. It requires users to type commands into a terminal to perform simple and/or complex tasks, such as 
* File manipulation
* Program execution
* System administration


Uses of the CLI
------
* Managing computer files and programs
* Interacting directly with the computer
* Excellent for debugging and troubleshooting your computer
* Controlling Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart home devices
* Providing remote access to networks and servers for better efficiency
* Building websites
* … and many more!


Why should I learn the CLI? How does it benefit me?
------
* Serves as a good intro for coding
* Improves your understanding of computer systems and underlying functions
* Can improve the productivity and flexibility of your code
* Is used in website building (like this very website!)
* is important for future career fields, like

 Career Field | Average Starting Salary 
 ------------ | ----------------------- 
 Cybersecurity | $70,000 to $85,000 
 Data Science | $100,000 to $125,000 
 Software Development | $83,937 to $99,405 
 Cloud Computing | $73,320 

*Data collected via Google’s Gemini AI Overview.*
