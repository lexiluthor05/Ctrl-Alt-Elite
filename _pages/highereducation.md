What is Modeling & Simulation (M&S)?
------
**Modeling:** Making a simple version of something real to study it.
**Simulation:** Using computers to see how things might work in real life.

Why is M&S Important?
------
* Helps scientists, engineers, and doctors solve problems.
* Used in video games, weather forecasts, medicine, and designing cars & airplanes.
* Many jobs need M&S skills, but not enough people are trained in it.

ODU and M&S
