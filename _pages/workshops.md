The first workshop was held at Norview High School on Wednesday, April 9th, 2025 after school. It was delivered by Elexiah Smart with the assistance of Dr. Wirawan Purwanto, Chunyu Hu, and Ted Birkland. About 14-16 students attended the workshop, as organized by the high school teacher, Mr. Michael McDonald. 

The workshop lasted about an hour and a half in total, involving PowerPoint lecture time, a live demonstration, and a hands-on demo activity in which the students competed for a prize to see who could get the furthest in the BanditLabs levels. 

Overall, the students seemed highly engaged and interested in the topics discussed, and this workshop achieved its goal of introducing younger audiences to cyber-related topics of which they may have never previously been exposed to.
