This website was developed to house all necessary materials and resources needed for students to participate in the T3-CIDERS outreach workshop, created by Elexiah Smart under the guidance of Dr. Wirawan Purwanto, Dr. Peng Jiang, Dr. Mohan Yang, and delivered with the assistance of Dr. Wirawan Purwanto, Chunyu Hu, and Ted Birkland.


What is T3-CIDERS?
======
T3-CIDERS is a train-the-trainer program for advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) skills that is designed to be synergistic with research, teaching, and learning activities in cybersecurity and cyber-related disciplines. Essentially, it is a program that helps teachers and researchers learn advanced technology skills to improve cybersecurity and trains them to share their knowledge with others and build a community focused on protecting digital information.

To find more information about T3-CIDERS, visit the project's website [here](https://sites.wp.odu.edu/t3-ciders/).

T3-CIDERS also uses their DeapSECURE lessons on topics like high-performance computing (HPC), big data, machine learning, and more to combine high-performance computational techniques into cybersecurity research and education. DeapSECURE stands for Data-Enabled Advanced Computational Training Platform for Cybersecurity Research and Education. You can find more information about that [here](https://deapsecure.gitlab.io/).


What is the Command Line Interface?
======
The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with software and operating systems. It requires users to type commands into a terminal to perform simple and/or complex tasks, such as 
* File manipulation
* Program execution
* System administration


Uses of the CLI
------
* Managing computer files and programs
* Interacting directly with the computer
* Excellent for debugging and troubleshooting your computer
* Controlling Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart home devices
* Providing remote access to networks and servers for better efficiency
* Building websites
* … and many more!


Why should I learn the CLI? How does it benefit me?
------
* Serves as a good intro for coding
* Improves your understanding of computer systems and underlying functions
* Can improve the productivity and flexibility of your code
* Is used in website building (like this very website!)
* is important for future career fields, like

| Career Field | Average Starting Salary |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Cybersecurity | $70,000 to $85,000 |
| Data Science | $100,000 to $125,000 |
| Software Development | $83,937 to $99,405 |
| Cloud Computing | $73,320 |
*Data collected via Google’s Gemini AI Overview.*
